# Analysis-of-glioma-RNA-Seq-data

Analysis pipeline used to analyze RNA-Seq data of DCs co-cultured with glioma GL261 cells, treated with either PS-PDT and MTX, and public availible datasets from TCGA, CGGA and GEO repositories.

The commands used to analyze the RNA-Seq data investigated in our manuscript can be found here. *main* file contains the basic commands to generate the results that were used for our study below:
